Apple A Day (symptom curing application)

#How does this App work?

The Apple a Day application was designed to allow users 
experiencing a certain symptom to choose their symptom
from the application's assorted list of buttons. Upon
clicking a symptom the application shows info regarding
cause of symptom and recommended nutrient to treat it.

A list of foods containing this nutrient is returned to
user sorted by greatest to least nutrient content.
